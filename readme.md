This project is from freeCodeCamp at https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer

The wikiSearch.html page takes a search string from the user, and displays the first 10 results from the wikipedia API. If there are no results, it will display a message to the screen saying so.

All results are contained in individual divs with hover animations and perform linking to the relevant wikipedia pages. 

Requires jquery 1.8 or later.
